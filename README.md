* [flask_heroku_redirector](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/flask_heroku_redirector) - Python Flask example application that demostrates using Heroku as a C2 redirector.
* [flask_pythonanywhere_redirector](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/flask_pythonanywhere_redirector) - Python Flask example application that demostrates using python-anywhere as a C2 redirector.
* [flask_appengine_redirector](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/flask_appengine_redirector) - Python Flask example application that demostrates using Google App engine as a C2 redirector.
* [CobaltStrike-ToolKit](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit) - Various collection of tools and scripts over the years for CS.


##### Host Collection & Modules

* [SetWindowsHookEx-Keylogger](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/SetWindowsHookEx-Keylogger) - Example implementation of a Windows C++ Native Keylogger using SetWindowsHookEx
* [HastySeries](https://github.com/obscuritylabs/HastySeries) - C# toolset to support offensive operators to triage, asses and make intelligent able decisions. 
* [minidump-lib](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/minidump-lib) - C++ MiniDumpWriteDump static lib example, with CLI
* [Invoke-EncryptedZip.ps1](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/PenTesting-Scripts/blob/master/Invoke-EncryptedZip.ps1) - Invoke-EncryptedZip is a utility to make a Enrypted Zip compresed file from a provided folder. This allows users to stage files in designated folder for exfil, or protection from final storage location.
* [Invoke-RPCArchitectureCheck%20.ps1](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/PenTesting-Scripts/blob/master/Invoke-RPCArchitectureCheck%20.ps1) - Invoke-RPCArchitectureCheck is a simple utility to use a crafted RPC packet to check a remote hosts arch. Returns is x86 or x64. Based off research into remote service kernel exploitation and loaders.


##### Sniffers

* [Winsock-PCAP](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/Winsock-PCAP) - Demonstrates a POC of how an older method yet safe native PCAP can take place using the Winsock2 library on Windows. This uses a reflective DLL injection to deploy and named pipes using a PowerShell POC communicator.
* [NIX-Sniffer-Examples](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/NIX-Sniffer-Examples) - Linux Python 2.7 Socket sniffer (Layer 3 and up), OSX Libpcap monitor mode test and sniffer research.
